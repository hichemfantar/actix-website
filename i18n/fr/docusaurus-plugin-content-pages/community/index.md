Want to talk to others about questions? The Actix Web [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NWpN5mmg3x) is the best starting point. We also have a [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/actix/actix-web).

If you think you found a bug it's best to file an issue directly on the repo. [actix/actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) for the web framework. [actix/actix](https://github.com/actix/actix) for issues with the actor framework

We're a welcoming community so don't be afraid to engage. Interactions are [governed by our code of conduct](/community/coc).
